    body: `Is not building strength and muscle the same thing?
    Yes and no is the short answer. It takes strength to build muscle over time, and it takes muscle to build strength. What differs between the two is that muscle growth occurs best in the interval of 6-12 repetitions. Sometimes you can train with even more repetitions for increased muscle mass.
    To build strength and explosiveness, it is different. There you should get your body used to extreme load for a short period, and then you have to train close to your maximum lift; the repetitions will therefore only be between 1-6.
    The two thus overlap a lot, but the more experienced you become in the gym, the more the choice of strength or muscle growth will come into play.
    
    However, it is essential to point out that you need to change your programs over time. You can not always lift 3-6 times for strength or 6-12 for muscle growth. Your body will get used to it and stop growing; then, it’s time to shock it with a completely new approach for a while before you go back to the old again.

What do muscle mass training programs often look like?
To increase muscle mass, you should lift as much as possible in the interval 6-12. Even if you get tired in your muscles, you can lower the weight and do one more set. If you are aiming to build strength a rested body before every set is a must but for muscle growth you should keep on going with more and more sets and reps.
Be sure to eat proper protein during exercise programs. Also, make sure you get adequate sleep. Just exercising without these two will significantly impair your muscle growth.`,

    title: "How to build muscles as a vegan",

    body: `Eating a vegan diet means excluding all animal source foods (ASF) such as meat, dairy products, and eggs. It is perhaps obvious that these foods do not belong in a diet consisting solely of vegetables, but food sometimes contain additives from other sources, such as gelatin, which often is produced from swine lard. In other words, it may take some detective work to be sure that you only are served the substances or foods you prefer.

    There is no evidence that it would be unhealthy or dangerous to follow a vegan diet. A diet consisting of a large proportion of vegetables is rather associated with increased health. However, if you exercise a lot and want to build muscle, you may need to think about a few things:
    
    Total energy content
    If you eat a mixed diet, it is usually easier to ingest larger amounts of energy compared to if you eat a vegan diet, and this is one of the reasons why it would be healthy for a large percentage of the population to increase the intake of food from the plant kingdom. If you are on an energy deficit, that is, you spend more energy than you eat and drink, the body’s stress system is activated. This is necessary as it allows us to assimilate the energy stored in the body. The stress response also ensures that available energy is prioritized and primarily transported to parts of the body that perform vital functions such as the brain, heart, and respiratory muscles. This results in a reduced ability for the muscles to increase their size and strength after exercise. After a long period of energy deficiency, muscle tissue begins to break down to, among other things, lower the body’s total energy consumption. All in all, a lack of energy, and an activation of the stress reactions, means that you survive an energy deficit, but for those who train and want to build muscle, it is not an optimal situation.`,

      "That’s why you become more alert and perform better with intake of caffeine",

    body: `The annual Memorial Gander competition was held earlier today in Chiasso, Switzerland, where Alice D’Amato of Italy dominated in the women’s field while Illia Kovtun of Ukraine fought back from a rough start on floor to win the men’s title by just under a tenth.

D’Amato got off to a strong start on vault, where her Yurchenko double earned a 14.1, more than half a point ahead of the rest of the field. She continued with a great set on bars, showing mostly only minor form issues throughout, and though she did struggle a bit with the front full pirouette, finishing it at horizontal, she recovered well from that to hit the double front with just a small hop to earn a 14.25.
    
Opting to compete floor for her last event – the women only had to compete three here, and were able to choose which ones – D’Amato finished on a high note, landing the whip whip through to triple especially well in her opening tumbling line. Her double pike landed a bit deep with a hop forward, there was a hop forward out of the front double full, and she had a near fall out of the double wolf turn, but she was able to save all three mistakes from becoming larger dramas to earn a 13.45, the highest floor score of the competition to add to her 41.800 all-around total.
    
The others who finished on the podium here were not part of my predictions, but both Lena Bickel of Switzerland with the silver medal and Morgane Osyssek of France with the bronze had the strongest performances of the bunch, coming up with no falls on a day where beam was especially tragic for most of the athletes.
    
Bickel, this year’s national all-around silver medalist, looked fantastic, putting up a 13.55 for her strong vault and then following it up with a killer floor set that included a solid double layout, 2½ to front tuck, and double pike for a 13.2. There were a few wild moments in her beam set, including a big wobble on her flight series, a smaller one on the switch half, and then an iffy landing on the 2½ dismount, but compared to most, her routine was a success, picking up a 12.75 to bring her to a 39.500 overall.`,
